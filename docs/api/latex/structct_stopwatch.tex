\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Keeps track of time at a hardware level. 

This doesn\textquotesingle{}t work off of game ticks but rather the amount of real-\/world time that has passed between "{}laps"{} So the timer is dependent on quirks in hardware and nondeterministic

This is perfect for performance profiling but non-\/ideal for gameplay

If you want to keep track of game time you should accumulate the game tick\textquotesingle{}s/update\textquotesingle{}s delta time instead. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
